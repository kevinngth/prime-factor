# TDD: Prime Factors

Create a class / module called `PrimeFactors` and add a method/function called `generate`. 
Given an integer, it should return a list containing the prime factors in numerical sequence.
```
1 should return [] (because all prime numbers should be bigger than 1)
2 should return [2]
3 should return [3]
4 should return [2,2]
5 should return [5]
6 should return [2,3]
7 should return [7]
8 should return [2,2,2]
9 should return [3,3]
4620 should return [2,2,3,5,7,11]
```
